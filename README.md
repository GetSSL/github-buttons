## Github Image Buttons

Generate a static image with star count of any Github repository.   
See an example below for **[awesome-scala repo](https://github.com/lauris/awesome-scala)**.

![Example Github button](http://github.h-s.io/stars/lauris/awesome-scala)

To generate a button just request the following URL: **``http://github.h-s.io/stars/:username/:repo``** where ``:username`` is the owner of your desired repo and ``:repo`` is the name of repository. Basically the URL follows the same naming scheme as Github.

The generated button is just a PNG image and that means it can be easily embedded almost anywhere.   
There are already several services that provide rich Github buttons, but all of them require either iframe or javascript which is limiting for some use cases, e.g., for use in Github markdown documents. Some of the services that provide js/iframe buttons are: [GitHub Buttons](http://ghbtns.com/) by mdo and [github-buttons](https://github.com/ntkme/github-buttons) by ntkme.  

As you may notice the buttons generated by this service look very similar to Github Buttons by mdo. To save time and avoid reinventing the wheel this service only takes a screenshot of the requested button found at [ghbtns.com](http://ghbtns.com/). 
Precise and good looking button generation in the backend is not as trivial as one could think.  

Powered by phantom.js and GraphicsMagick – the core logic of this service is only few lines long. In the future I will consider hosting the HTML version of buttons locally to avoid external request to ghbtns.com.

The source code is available at Github – [lauris/github-buttons](https://github.com/lauris/github-buttons). Your feedback and contributions are always welcome. 

NB! This README.md file is also served as landing page at [github.h-s.io](http://github.h-s.io/)
